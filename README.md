    - Make sure that the current directory is the same as the directory of input.txt and project1.py
    - Enter the command python project1.py in the terminal [if the current python version is set to 3] otherwise use python3 project1.py
    - After the command is entered, output.txt file is generated automatically and saved in the same directory as input.txt and project1.py
